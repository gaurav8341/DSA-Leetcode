        #         anti_word += chr(a_c + 97)
        #     word += anti_word

        # in every iteration the sring is doubled. 
        # so 2^0 == 1 when the word == 'a' a+1 = 
        # 2^1 = 2 when word  == 'ab' and so on.
        # we need to foind how many times these operation happens 


        ##I still dont understand it fully

        # Each operation effectively adds the count of 1s in the binary representation of (k - 1) to the starting character 'a'
        # The number of operations needed corresponds to the number of bits in (k - 1)'s binary representation
        # Each '1' bit represents a character increment at that operation level
        return chr(ord('a') + (k - 1).bit_count())
